# Project Description:
## What:
This Project Aims at presenting the OSI model layers and each of their 
components and to mimick the packet handling of modern systems.

## When:
After being intrigued by just how many abstractions and protocols there are 
between the user and the Physical layer, and what fascinating an opportunity
to play around with algorithms within the in-between layers, I wanted to makes
something that would attempt to mimick the existing network systems and yet
still allow room for exploratory coding with my favourite language C++

## Who:
Any one can use my code for whatever reason they may please, however I am in 
no way responsible for any software faults that might arise in the use of this 
code. I have developed it for personal sport and not for implementation in 
working environments. Have fun as you try,test and read the code.

## Why:
I'm using this project to challenge my understanding of the OSI model as well 
as my understanding of C++
